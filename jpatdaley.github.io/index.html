    <p id="intro">Hello, stranger. Welcome to my portfolio page.</p>
<div id="div1"><p>
I'm a newcomer to the world of IT, entering with a background in finance, e-learning, and customer service. Throughout my time with Per Scholas I intend to soak in as much practical knowledge as possible.</p>
<p>I will often integrate my personal interests in the content of my projects. I've long been accused of habitually "navelgazing," and my interests admittedly don't conflict with that assessment.</p></div>

<div id="div2"><h3 class="heading">Some of these include</h3>
<ul>
    
    <li> <a href = "Pages/stories.html">Music, Nostalgia & Desire</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>and the one which somehow links all these matters together...</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href = "Pages/stories.html">Juggling</a></li>
</ul></div>
    <h4>I'd like to think that this image from many moons ago--and just as many pounds--presents my normal attire, but if given the chance I'm loyal to my cargo shorts.</h4>

<h5>Despite this fact, I'll wear a suit & tie everyday if needed to secure a dev role.</h5>

<p>I have spent a number of years handling interactions between sales departments and customers for financial institutions and e-learning companies. Few things are more important than the appropriate handling of personal finances, so I've developed fluid, on-the-spot conflict resolution for a variety of audiences--whether they be thousands of corporate employees waiting to start compliance courses, or a man on the verge of retirement, seeking immediate & concrete tax advice. I hope to translate these skills in the realm of programming, forging a more creative path than the one I've left behind.</p>
