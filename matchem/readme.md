Thank you for reading the readme.md file for Jonathan Daley's "Match 'Em" game which was first developed in the Per Scholas' Software Engineering course. Try the game out by visiting https://jpatdaley.github.io/matchem/index.html 

This game is a classic "memory game" which calls on the player to match two cards-at-a-time which had been previously hidden. I differentiated from other forms of this game by offering users variety in the grid size as well as the types of cards available (ranging from 4x4 to 4x6, and colored cards to classic cards.) 

On each board the player's performance is tracked by a score monitor, which increases by one unit every time a pair of matching cards are simultaneously uncovered. The player is prevented from uncovering more than two cards in each "round," so their performance is dependent solely on luck and memory. 

Players can navigate site primarily from the index page, but each board also provides a drop down menu which directs them to the index page and offers the ability to restart the game of their current board. 

I will be continuously updating this game throughout my time in the Per Scholas program. I verged from my original wireframe (https://wireframe.cc/gl1hrQ) due to conflicts with my current understanding of Javascript, so as time goes on I'll likely attempt to merge the various HTML pages into one.
