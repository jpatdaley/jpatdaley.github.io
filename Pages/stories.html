<h2>Music, Nostalgia & Desire</h2> <p>For most of my life I've felt conflicted by standard iterations of nostalgia. Most associate it with a longing for the past, and people often refer to music when they think of sources of nostalgia. I'm no different in this regard; music is the only thing which evokes my own nostalgic feelings and reflections. Here's where the kicker lies: in all of the music which holds this influence, I can recall how it affected me at a young age, and under all such early experiences my childhood self felt a profound anticipation of what-was-to-come. Music inspired me, and this inspiration had always been directed towards the future and potentiality.</p>
<p id="questions">Why was this a problem? Well, as a grown man I couldn't help but find it concerning that I was "longing to return home" when the very sources of longing had always directed my attention forward in time. If the future had been so intoxicating way back when, could this purported longing be all that substantial? Beyond that, could I state with confidence that I had ever felt content with the present moment?</p>
<img src="../Images/odysseus.jpeg">
<p>This matter came to a head when I re-read Homer's "Odyssey" in college. Odysseus--a masterful liar--spends a decade in Troy only to find himself plagued by absurd misfortune on his ten-year-long return home to Ithaca. He consistently directs his attention to his return, yet through various digressions he keeps the actual event at bay.</p>
<p>I won't pretend to understand Odysseus, much less Homer, but I can't help but think the stories refer to innate temporal conflicts we all experience in life. I was once horrified at the suggestion that we can never be content in the present, but I've relaxed my grip, and can once more appreciate longing in the various forms it's revealed. The future always holds relevance; it will always call us to stand and an act in the world, and this relevance is undoubtedly where desire dwells.</p></div>

<h2>Juggling</h2>
<p>Juggling--like desire--is an ek-static phenomenon (i.e., it takes one outside of himself, and throws him into the world.) Whereas desire gives the future utmost relevance (it shows us "what a difference a day makes"), juggling calls on us to take immediate responsibility through directed movement, trapping us in an invigorating pattern of immersion in the world. Jugglers often witness variations in the passage of time when learning new tricks (tricks once so swift they were impossible to apprehend can later be enacted through the juggler's own hands), and a new topography emerges when they realize that motion is no longer confined by the feet. The nuances of space, time, and our own embodiment are highlighted through extensive practice, and a playfulness emerges in regards to these insights. Time certainly isn't "in our own hands," but responsibilities pertaining to time are highlighted.</p>
<p id="questions">What lies behind this playfulness? I can't say it's essentially erotic, but I would suggest that all honest eroticism (let's be clear: I mean desire-based love, not sexuality) requires an acknowledgment of the aforementioned temporal conflicts, and by virtue requires us to acknowledge to that special other, "my days are endured by your presence and absence; in my attempts to grasp you I've been immersed in the world once again--a world which has called my attention since time immemorial." (Of course, with age most learn that various shoes do in fact fit, but it would be sacrilegious to emphasize this fact even to yourself during these periods.) This declaration is quite burdensome when written or spoken aloud, and stated as a declaration it misses the mark. This, I'd argue, is where the playfulness comes in. Like a shared dance, juggling immerses our embodied selves in the world through constant tosses and catches--through extended attempts to "grasp" something "out there."</p>
<p>My lone voice can't disclose this playfulness; that is something only encountered through dialogue (whether it be spoken dialogue or responsive movement.) To get a better glimpse, I recommend you take a look at the video of the two jugglers below, Bob & Trish. They forged their relationship through the practice of juggling & acrobatics. Such physical interactions (and responsibilities) allowed them to develop an intimacy so strong that they withheld from sharing their first kiss until their wedding day. They uncovered a beauty to the world through their love for one another, and this beauty would not have been accessible without their shared practice of juggling.</p>
